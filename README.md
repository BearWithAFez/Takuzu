## Errors and todo ##

Last done: 

* Made it so that each difficulty has 25 puzzles, totalling in whopping 100 puzzles!

Todo:

* The App.
* A puzzle solver and generator

But they are both seperate applications, so consider this finished.

Known errors:

* Flipping rapidly can break the UI.(Is a timing one, should be fixed...)
* It doesn't work on IE. And I can't be bothered to fix it.
